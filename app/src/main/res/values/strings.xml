    <string name="long_text">Millionaire Bruce Wayne was just a kid when he watched his parents get gunned down during a mugging in Gotham City.
             The crime would define his life, as he dedicated himself to becoming the world’s greatest weapon against crime—the Batman.
              Forget his Batarangs, Batmobile, or Utility Belt filled with high-tech weapons.
